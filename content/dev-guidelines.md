# Working with DevHub prompts

Follow these rules every time you act on a DevHub prompt.

## Read first, then act

- Read the entire prompt before executing any steps. DevHub prompts often include overlapping setup commands across sections; later sections frequently contain more complete versions of an earlier step.
- Do not infer or assume when provisioning Databricks resources (catalogs, schemas, Lakebase instances, Genie spaces, serving endpoints). Ask the user whether to create new resources or reuse existing ones.
- If you run into trouble, fetch additional templates and docs from https://dev.databricks.com (the index lives at https://dev.databricks.com/llms.txt). DevHub is the source of truth for the Databricks developer stack — for example, if Genie setup fails, fetch the Genie docs and templates instead of guessing.

## Engage the user in a conversation

Unless the user has explicitly told you to "just do it", treat every DevHub prompt as the start of a conversation, not an unattended script. The user knows their domain best; DevHub knows the Databricks stack. Both are required to build a successful system.

Follow these rules every time you ask a question:

1. **One question at a time.** Never ask multiple questions in a single message.
2. **Always include a final option for "Not sure — help me decide"** so the user is never stuck.
3. **Prefer interactive multiple-choice UI when available.** Before asking your first question, check your available tools for any structured-question or multiple-choice capability. If one exists, **always** use it instead of plain text. Known tools by environment:
   - **Cursor**: use the `AskQuestion` tool.
   - **Claude Code**: use the `MultipleChoice` tool (from the `mcp__desktopCommander` server, or built-in depending on setup).
   - **Other agents**: look for any tool whose description mentions "multiple choice", "question", "ask", "poll", or "select".
4. **Fall back to a formatted text list** only when you have confirmed no interactive tool is available. Use markdown list syntax so each option renders on its own line, and tell the user they can reply with just the letter or number.

### Example: Cursor (`AskQuestion` tool)

```
AskQuestion({
  questions: [{
    id: "app-type",
    prompt: "What kind of app would you like to build?",
    options: [
      { id: "dashboard", label: "A data dashboard" },
      { id: "chatbot", label: "An AI-powered chatbot" },
      { id: "crud", label: "A CRUD app with Lakebase" },
      { id: "other", label: "Something else (describe it)" },
      { id: "unsure", label: "Not sure — help me decide" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

### Example: plain text fallback

Only use this when no interactive tool is available:

What kind of app would you like to build? Reply with the letter to choose:

- a) A data dashboard
- b) An AI-powered chatbot
- c) A CRUD app with Lakebase
- d) Something else (describe it)
- e) Not sure — help me decide

## Default workflow

Unless instructed otherwise, follow this workflow:

1. Understand the user's intent and goals (see the intent block below for what the user just copied).
2. Verify the local Databricks dev environment (the "Verify your local Databricks dev environment" block in the intent section).
3. Ask follow-up questions where needed and walk the user through the build step by step.
4. Build the app or agent.
5. Make it look great (see "Make it look great" below).
6. Run and test locally.
7. Deploy to production.

## Make it look great

The default templates that AppKit provides are intentionally minimal — a starting point, not a finished product. **Do not stop there.** Use the user's feature requests to redesign the routes, page hierarchy, and visuals from first principles, and make the UI look great _before_ asking the user to run and test locally. Showing the user something polished early changes the conversation.

Unless the user has specified a design preference, use these defaults:

- shadcn/ui components on top of Tailwind CSS.
- Clean hierarchy with modern spacing — not too many stacked cards.
- Modern, minimal design language.
- Databricks brand palette: `#FF3621`, `#0B2026`, `#EEEDE9`, `#F9F7F4`.

If an existing codebase has its own design system, follow that system instead.

## When you run into issues

Use the GitHub CLI (if available) or generate a copy-pastable error report for the user to file at https://github.com/databricks/devhub/issues. Greatly appreciated if you first check for an existing matching open issue and comment "+1" rather than opening a duplicate.
